    <h4><strong>Step C1</strong></h4>
    <p>
        If you operate the AuthenticationServer, you can add a client by directly editing it's database. In a production environment, this entry would be generated by an admin console or a client API Key Request Page.  If you do not operate the resource owner, then you must contact the service in some way to get the keys.
    </p>

    <h4><strong>Step C2</strong></h4>
    <p>
        Configure the ClientApplication by entering the ClientID in this form. Each meteor site operates differently, so there is not unified API website to goto.  The AuthenticationServer will need the following a Redirect URI:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Redirect URI: {{base_url}}_oauth/MeteorOAuth2Server</li>
    </ol>
